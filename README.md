**Requirements:** 
  1) Fill mongodb connection info in configuration.py
  2) Fill Kafka broker IPs in configuration.py
  3) Create a topic in kafka with a large number of partitions / fill topic name in configuration.py


**How to install it:**
 1) clone repository

 2) go to clone folder

 3) install: `sudo pip/pip3 -e install .`


**How to run it:**
 1) Run consumer:
       `Python crawler/run.py`
 
 Note: For better response time, run the above on multiple instances of the consumer using different processes to increase parallelism.
 Alternatively Use docker swarm or marathon to start many containers. I will add Dockerfile.

 2) Start the web service:
        `Python crawler/webservice.py`


**Note:** For Architecture and documentation look at the doc folder.

**Note:** The code is tested with Python3.
